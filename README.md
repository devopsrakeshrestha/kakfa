**Architecture Overview**

**ZooKeeper:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0

Ports: 
Exposes port 2181, which is the ZooKeeper client port.

Role: 
ZooKeeper manages and coordinates the Kafka brokers. Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for leader election, partition assignment, and to maintain distributed consensus. It persists its data and logs in Docker volumes for durability across container restarts.

Volumes:
zookeeper-data: 
Stores ZooKeeper's persistent data.

zookeeper-logs: 
Stores ZooKeeper's logs.

**Kafka Broker:**
Docker Image:
confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0

Ports:
29092: For internal Docker networking (other services communicate with this port).
9092: Exposes the Kafka broker locally.
9093: Allows for external connections (e.g., access from outside the Docker network).
9101: JMX monitoring port.

Role: 
Kafka is the distributed message broker that stores and manages event streams. It connects with ZooKeeper and exposes listeners for different clients:
PLAINTEXT for internal Docker networking.
EXTERNAL for clients outside Docker.

Volumes:
kafka-data: Stores Kafka's logs and topics.
Kafka brokers rely on ZooKeeper for their coordination, and the depends_on property ensures ZooKeeper is up before the broker starts.

**Schema Registry:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:7.5.0

Ports: 
8081 for serving schema registry requests.

Role: 
The Schema Registry manages Avro schemas for Kafka messages. It ensures that messages follow a defined structure, allowing compatibility checks between producers and consumers. The registry is crucial for services like Kafka Connect, which use Avro.

Dependencies: 
It relies on the Kafka broker for message validation using the schemas and integrates with it over port 29092.

**Kafka Connect:**
Docker Image: 
cnfldemos/kafka-connect-datagen:0.6.2-7.5.0

Ports: 
8083 for Kafka Connect's REST API.

Role: 
Kafka Connect is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems like databases and file systems. It uses connectors to ingest and export data into and out of Kafka topics. In this setup, it’s integrated with the broker and schema registry.

Environment Variables:
Configures topics to store its internal state, offsets, and status.
Connects with the Schema Registry for data conversion.

**ksqldb-server:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/cp-ksqldb-server:7.5.0

Ports: 
8088 for ksqlDB's REST API.

Role: 
ksqlDB enables real-time stream processing using SQL-like queries. It can process Kafka topics in real time, allowing you to create, transform, and enrich streams using familiar SQL statements.

Dependencies:
Connects to the broker for Kafka topics.
Connects to the schema registry for structured data processing.
Connects to Kafka Connect for interacting with external systems.

**ksqldb-cli:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/cp-ksqldb-cli:7.5.0

Role: 
Provides a command-line interface for interacting with ksqlDB. It depends on the ksqldb-server, broker, and schema registry for processing Kafka streams.

**ksql-datagen:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/ksqldb-examples:7.5.0

Role:
A data generator for testing purposes. It generates mock data for Kafka topics, which can be useful for testing stream processing pipelines. It waits for Kafka and the Schema Registry to be fully ready before generating data.

**REST Proxy:**
Docker Image: 
confluentinc/cp-kafka-rest:7.5.0

Ports:
8082 for REST API access to Kafka.

Role:
Kafka REST Proxy provides a RESTful interface to Kafka, allowing developers to produce and consume messages without directly interacting with Kafka clients. This is useful for lightweight integrations or scenarios where language-specific Kafka clients are unavailable.

Dependencies:
It communicates with the broker and schema registry to produce and consume Avro-encoded messages.

**AKHQ (Kafka GUI):**
Docker Image: 
tchiotludo/akhq:0.19.0

Ports: 
8080 for accessing the AKHQ web UI.

Role:
AKHQ is a web-based UI for managing Kafka clusters. It allows administrators to browse topics, view partitions, consumers, and producers, and manage Kafka configurations.

Environment Variables:
Specifies the Kafka connection details and authentication for accessing the broker.
Data Volumes
The volumes in the setup are critical for persisting data beyond container lifecycles:

zookeeper-data:
Stores ZooKeeper’s state information.

zookeeper-logs: 
Stores logs generated by ZooKeeper.

kafka-data: 
Stores Kafka’s data logs, including messages and topic configurations.

External Connection Considerations
The Kafka broker exposes an external listener on port 9093, mapped to the IP 10.126.0.56. This configuration is necessary for clients outside the Docker network to connect to Kafka.
AKHQ provides a user-friendly web interface to monitor and manage Kafka clusters, making it easy to observe topic status, brokers, partitions, and more.

**Summary of Flow**
ZooKeeper coordinates the Kafka broker.
Kafka broker manages distributed messaging and is accessible internally and externally.
Schema Registry ensures message structure validation.
Kafka Connect integrates Kafka with external systems.
ksqlDB enables stream processing.
REST Proxy offers an HTTP interface for lightweight interaction with Kafka.
AKHQ offers a UI for managing and observing Kafka clusters.
Data persistence ensures logs and state are not lost across restarts.
This architecture is suitable for production-level event-driven architectures where real-time data processing and integration with external systems are required. The combination of stream processing (ksqlDB), schema management, and REST proxy access makes it a comprehensive solution for handling data streams.
